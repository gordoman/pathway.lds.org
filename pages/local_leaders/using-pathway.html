            <p class="main-content">Pathway has been designed around three primary objectives, which
              are intended to serve as a catalyst in students' lives both academically
              and economically. In addition to the obvious educational and career
              benefits Pathway provides, perhaps the most valuable aspect of this
              program for the students who participate is the spiritual nourishment
              that comes through regular gospel study and the association of fellow
              students. Pathway's objectives are:
            </p>
        
            <!-- Numbered Header -->
            <p class="p-heading2 blue">1. GET THE GOSPEL DOWN INTO STUDENTS' HEARTS</p>
                <p class="main-content">Students' testimonies will grow as they enjoy the fellowship of other
              LDS students and participate in courses taught within the framework
              of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
            </p>

            <p class="p-heading2 blue">2. HELP STUDENTS BECOME CAPABLE LEARNERS</p>
            <p class="main-content">Pathway eases students into higher education and helps them build
              confidence in a supportive environment. As part of BYU-Idaho's
              Learning Model, students take control of their own learning through a
              process of preparation, teaching others, and internalizing their
              learning through reflection and application.
            </p>
          
            <p class="p-heading2 blue">3. PREPARE STUDENTS TO LEAD AND SUPPORT FAMILIES</p>
            <p class="main-content">Throughout their education, Pathway students will gain skills, learn
              doctrine, and strengthen values that will enable them to gain
              meaningful employment as well as be better parents, providers,
              citizens, and Church members.
            </p>
                      
            <p class="main-content">Many Pathway students have reported significant benefits relative to
              their participation in Pathway. Students surveyed near the completion
              of their first year in the program have reported the following:
            </p>
            
            <img alt="pathway-statistics" class="center-block img-responsive img-space" src="../../img/local-leaders/percentage_chart.png">

           <p class="main-content">Pathway can be a great blessing to priesthood leaders who support
              the program and use it as a key part of their ministry. Many priesthood
              leaders have recognized the blessings Pathway can provide and use
              the program as a rescue tool with spiritually less-active or inactive
              Church members.
            </p>

            <p class="p-heading blue">Foundation</p>
            <p class="main-content"  style="margin-bottom:50px;">For more than 120 years, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
              Saints has been offering educational opportunities to students in
              Rexburg, Idaho. However, it has long been realized that there is more
              the Church can do to provide a Church-based education to many
              more individuals. In 1971, Henry B. Eyring said the following in his
              inaugural address as president of then Ricks College:

            <p class="main-content">Both of these men echoed a similar sentiment: BYU-Idaho must find
              ways to educate more students. And in 2009, a new program was
              introduced to do just that. Partnering with existing institutes of religion,
              the BYU-Idaho Pathway program was launched in three U.S. locations
              with about 50 students, and it has now grown to thousands of students
              in dozens of locations worldwide. The university has truly found, as
              Elder Eyring said, "direct ways to move the blessings of education ...
              from this campus out into the lives of men and woman everywhere."
