     <p>Pathway has been designed around three primary objectives, which
      are intended to serve as a catalyst in students' lives both academically
      and economically. In addition to the obvious educational and career
      benefits Pathway provides, perhaps the most valuable aspect of this
      program for the students who participate is the spiritual nourishment
      that comes through regular gospel study and the association of fellow
      students. Pathway's objectives are:
    </p>
    <p>Students' testimonies will grow as they enjoy the fellowship of other
      LDS students and participate in courses taught within the framework
      of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <!-- Numbered Header -->
    <p class="text-header">1. GET THE GOSPEL DOWN INTO STUDENTS' HEARTS</p>
    <p>Pathway eases students into higher education and helps them build
      confidence in a supportive environment. As part of BYU-Idaho's
      Learning Model, students take control of their own learning through a
      process of preparation, teaching others, and internalizing their
      learning through reflection and application.
    </p>
    <!-- Numbered Header -->
    <p class="text-header">2. HELP STUDENTS BECOME CAPABLE LEARNERS</p>
    <p>Throughout their education, Pathway students will gain skills, learn
      doctrine, and strengthen values that will enable them to gain
      meaningful employment as well as be better parents, providers,
      citizens, and Church members.
    </p>
    <!-- Numbered Header -->
    <p class="text-header">3. PREPARE STUDENTS TO LEAD AND SUPPORT FAMILIES</p>
    <p>Many Pathway students have reported significant benefits relative to
      their participation in Pathway. Students surveyed near the completion
      of their first year in the program have reported the following:

<p>Pathway can be a great blessing to priesthood leaders who support
  the program and use it as a key part of their ministry. Many priesthood
  leaders have recognized the blessings Pathway can provide and use
  the program as a rescue tool with spiritually less-active or inactive
  Church members.

<p class="text-header-italics">Foundation</p>
<p>For more than 120 years, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
  Saints has been offering educational opportunities to students in
  Rexburg, Idaho. However, it has long been realized that there is more
  the Church can do to provide a Church-based education to many
  more individuals. In 1971, Henry B. Eyring said the following in his
  inaugural address as president of then Ricks College:

   “We must also find ways for this college to
   serve young people whose needs are
   shaped by a great variety of cultures and
   situations, and who may not be able to
   come to this campus.... We will find direct
   ways to move the blessings of education
   ... from this campus out into the lives of
   men and women everywhere."

 <p>Both of these men echoed a similar sentiment: BYU-Idaho must find
  ways to educate more students. And in 2009, a new program was
  introduced to do just that. Partnering with existing institutes of religion,
  the BYU-Idaho Pathway program was launched in three U.S. locations
  with about 50 students, and it has now grown to thousands of students
  in dozens of locations worldwide. The university has truly found, as
  Elder Eyring said, "direct ways to move the blessings of education ...
  from this campus out into the lives of men and woman everywhere."
