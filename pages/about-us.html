            <p> Pathway is a low-cost educational opportunity that combines online
              courses with local gatherings. Participants gain valuable skills that
              will serve them throughout their lives and in pursuing a college
              degree. As a program of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
              Saints, students will also receive the spiritual benefits of a
              gospel-incorporated education. Brigham Young University-Idaho has
              greatly helped and influenced the development of Pathway. </p>
            <p> Inspired leadership and innovative education have been fundamental
              qualities in the history of BYU-Idaho and Pathway. The Church of
              Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been offering educational
              opportunities to students in Rexburg, Idaho, for more than 120 years.
              What started as an elementary school in 1888 has now blossomed
              into a four-year university that serves thousands of students across
              the world. </p>
            <p> For years, Church and school leaders have recognized the need for
              educational opportunities to extend beyond the city limits of Rexburg
              and into the far reaches of the Earth. </p>
            <p> In 1971, Henry B. Eyring, then president of Ricks College, declared
              the following in his inaugural address: </p>

              <p>In 2009, BYU-Idaho introduced Pathway, a program
              designed to help students prepare for earning a college degree
              through online courses and weekly gatherings with others. What
              started as a humble pilot program of three sites in the United States
              serving roughly 50 students has emerged into a successful
              educational system of over 150 worldwide sites, serving thousands
              of students each year. As President Eyring suggested, the university
              has truly found “direct ways to move the blessings of education …
              from this campus out into the lives of men and women everywhere.”</p>

              <p>Since its creation, Pathway has blessed lives more than just
              academically. Priesthood leaders have utilized Pathway as a tool to
              help bring Church members back into the open arms of the gospel.
              Many students express that their testimonies have been nurtured
              and strengthened through course work and interaction with others.
              Hundreds of couples and individuals have also served the Church as
              Pathway missionaries.</p>

              <p>As each semester passes, we continue to see the blessings of
              Pathway touch the lives of Church members across the world. In
              2011, Pathway was introduced on an international level, providing
              the program to students in Puebla, Mexico, and Christiansborg,
              Ghana. Since then, international sites have opened in over 16
              countries (as of 2014). These international sites vary in culture,
              climate, and language but they share the bonds of the gospel and a desire for higher education. Pathway has also extended to over 100
              domestic sites within the United States and Canada. With these
              expanding opportunities, over 2,000 students have completed
              Pathway and started the BYU-Idaho Online Degree Program.</p> <br>

              <p>Pathway will continue to open doors of education and hope
                throughout the world. As the program grows, we will always seek the
                most efficient ways to serve all who are involved. We have truly seen
                the hand of the Lord throughout the development and progress of
                Pathway. He is in charge and He directs this work. We are excited to
                see what the future holds for Pathway, and we are confident that,
                with the Lord’s help, thousands of lives will continue to be blessed.</p>
